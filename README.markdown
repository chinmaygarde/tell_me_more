Sinatra New
-----------

A new Sinatra project template. This is what I end up using almost everytime.

Features
--------

* Automatic code reloading in development mode
* Spec directories are setup
* Default template (admittedly very amateurish) to get you started
* Authentication using omniauth implemented
* Directory structure setup
* Common rake tasks prepared
* Console setup with code reloading (script/console)
* Factories using factory_girl

TODOS
-----

* Add authentication providers (See the authentications.yml.example)


* Modify the finders in the ApplicationController according to the ORM in use
